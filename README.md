# Pet-Classification-Model-Using-CNN

Objective:
The aim of this project is to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that classifies pet images correctly into dog and cat images. The dataset comprises of images of different sizes with varied lighting conditions, which will be used as inputs for the model. The CNN model will be created using TensorFlow and it will be trained on the given dataset. The accuracy score on the test data will be calculated to evaluate the model's performance.

Dataset:
The dataset consists of images of pets, i.e., cats and dogs. It is a collection of images that have been divided between cats and dogs. The images are stored in two folders, one for cats and one for dogs. Each image in the dataset has been named using a unique identifier, and the images are of varying sizes with different lighting conditions.
